This is a small interviewee management system
# Allow the interviewee create their account with login form.
# Once the interviewee gets their account, they can move to their add information form and display it on their website.
# Here is the form that they can input in
1. index.html -> This page allows them to create their account and log into add form
2. form.html  -> This page allows them to input to their information
3. view-candidate.html -> This page allows them to display their information on a webpage.
